# Parental Data Access Guidelines

This folder contains the SafeNutriKids **Parental Data Access Guidelines** 
as contributed to the DRG4FOOD Toolbox.

The materials provide design and implementation guidance for:

- parental and child profile relationships  
- consent handling  
- access and correction rights  
- auditability and responsible data practices  

These resources are documentation-only and not part of the Python package.
Additional technical materials will be added in due course.
